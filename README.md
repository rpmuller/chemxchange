Simple tools to interchange molecular formats. There are many other tools to
interchange molecular formats, e.g.
* [cclib](https://github.com/cclib/cclib)
* [chemfiles](https://github.com/chemfiles/chemfiles)
* [openbabel](https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel)
You'll probably be happier using one of these. I'm just playing with some
ideas here.
